Started messing around with node shield a bit the artifact is pretty well documented to explain some of the cli tools. However some of the time it takes to evaluate is longer than what they advertised possibly could be they were just on stronger computers where I was on just a laptop.

I have been trying to understand how to evaluate the results I get from the tests they provide and compare with what they said in the paper. Hopefully once I get a complete run I will have a better understanding.
