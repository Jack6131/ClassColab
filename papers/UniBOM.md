## Thoughts
Paper seemed to be more of a way of bridging two tools already in existence to make a better tool known as unibom its not very novel as i was hoping a bit of a let down however did lead to some things I might follow up on specifically with Syft and CCScanner which seemed to be doing the package analysis for C/C++ as well as looking at Conan as C package manager might be of some use but I need to also look more into that.
